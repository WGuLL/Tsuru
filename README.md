The projects use FRUT to turn the .jucer files into CMakelists files.
Hopefully it will be useful later to add some CI more easily.

When I create music, I like good sounding, simple and straight forward audio plugins. Therefore that's 
what I'd like to achieve with the plugins I create.

Not sure yet but I want to do something with filters and rhythm.
For now the plugin simply applies a succession of cutoff frequencies
in sync with the bpm.
